# Circuit Buddy
## Overview
A simple digital circuits toolbox that has an intuitive UI. Designed for students studying digital circuits. Built by Jeffrey Xiao,
Kevin Pei, Nick Bo, and Daniel Tong. Circuit Buddy was a top 30 finalist at PennApps XV Ad Astra.

Features:
 - Auto-updating truth table
 - Multiple tabs
 - Importing and exporting with json text or images
 - Circuit simplification with the Quineâ€“McCluskey algorithm
 - Custom components

The backend is a simple flask server that handles the endpoints for openCV and the Quine-McCluskey algorithm. The frontend
is vanilla javascript built on [FabricJS](http://fabricjs.com/) and Vue for most of the UI components.

* Clone the repository
* Install dependencies with ```node install```
* Use webpack to watch the client-side js with ```webpack --watch```
* (Optional) Use development node server with ```node server```

## Structure
Logic for the quine-mcluskey algorithm is handled in [qm.py](/qm.py) and openCV in [openCv.py](/openCv.py). The structure and logic  for the user interface is located under [components](/static/js/src/components/) as Vue components. The Vue components call library functions located under [lib](/static/js/src/lib/).
